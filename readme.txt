Synopsis

As group we decided to work on each page individually. I worked on the menu cart page. A JS widget allowing end users to select multiple products from a menu card. The total cost of each item would accumulate. Users would have the choice to select or unselect product.


Motivation

Group project at the New York Code and Design Academy in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The scope of the project was to create a restaurant website.
